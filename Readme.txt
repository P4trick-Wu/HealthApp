Instructions for setting up application:

Install npm packages using the npm install command. When setting up the database, match the database setup such as name, host and password as 
the ones in the .env file, or modify the .env file to fit. Then use the ddl.sql file to generate tables, fill a couple columns with the dml.sql 
file and the application should be usable. 

Note: Only trainer and member accounts are insert by the dml.sql file for password encryption reasons, you need to register member accounts 
by hand.
